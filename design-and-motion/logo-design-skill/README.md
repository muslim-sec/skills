# Logo Design Skill for Claude & AI Agents

[![Tests](https://github.com/kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![The New 100: #14](https://www.theagenticleaderboard.com/badges/new/logo-design-skill.svg)](#)

![Eighteen example runs of the logo-design skill](docs/images/hero.png)

A comprehensive **logo-design skill** that turns Claude — or any agent that supports Agent Skills, such as Gemini
CLI, Codex CLI, Cursor or GitHub Copilot — into a disciplined identity designer, from the first brief to
production-ready SVG files and brand guidelines.

- **Principles & process** — discovery and briefs, word mapping, choosing the right mark type, concepting,
  geometric construction, optical corrections (overshoot, bone effect, irradiation…), colour, typography, lockups,
  testing, presentation, delivery, redesigns and identity systems.
- **A reference library of 1,400+ real-world SVG logos**, each visually classified by mark type, technique,
  geometry, subject, typography, mood and industry — searchable from the command line and browsable in a local
  gallery. Used to study construction, map category conventions and avoid look-alikes (never to copy).
- **Dependency-free Python tools** — audit an SVG against logo principles, build concept overview sheets and test
  sheets (16 px pixel test, one-colour, reversed, squint, mirror, contexts, competitor shelf test), create client
  presentation boards with industry-specific mockups, render PNGs, and export a complete favicon / app-icon /
  web-manifest set.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Brief<br/>questions or stated assumptions] --> B[Research<br/>category conventions in the library]
    B --> C[Concepts<br/>8–12 one-liners → build 3 in SVG]
    C --> D[Test & refine<br/>audit · 16 px · one-colour · shelf test]
    D --> E{{Checkpoint<br/>show concepts, recommend, stop}}
    E -- "you pick a direction<br/>and ask for the kit" --> F[Kit<br/>colour · lockups · board · icons · guidelines]
    E -- "you want changes" --> C
```

The skill always **stops at the checkpoint**: it shows the concepts as one overview image with a recommendation and
offers the full kit. Nothing else is produced until you choose a direction — the kit is most of the work and only
makes sense for an approved idea.

## Examples

Eighteen fictional briefs, from quiet luxury and neon festivals to B2B SaaS, fintech and health — each run end to
end with the skill. For every brand you see exactly what the skill shows at the checkpoint (greyscale concepts with
true 64/32/16 px sizes and a recommendation), followed by a colour preview of the chosen direction on mockups picked
for that industry. Later batches deliberately push **vivid, saturated palettes** while still passing the one-colour
and 3 : 1 contrast checks. The newest batch takes on three crowded categories: **SaaS** (no chat bubbles, charts or
padlocks), **finance** (no coins, piggy banks or bank blue) and **health** (no crosses, pills or heartbeat lines).

### Kiln — specialty coffee roaster
*Small-batch roaster in Istanbul: warm, crafted and modern — not rustic cliché. Must work on bags, cups and an Instagram avatar.*

![Kiln concepts](docs/images/kiln-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Kiln K** — a K whose leg is the kiln's arched firing mouth; the arch returns as the *n* of the wordmark. The audit caught a 60.8° diagonal in an early *N* and an off-centre symbol before anything was shown.

![Kiln in use](docs/images/kiln-board.png)

### Zestly — food delivery app
*Independent local kitchens delivered in 25 minutes: fresh, fast, appetising, cheeky — no forks, chef hats, scooters or map pins.*

![Zestly concepts](docs/images/zestly-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Big Grin** — a citrus wedge flipped into a cheeky, winking grin: appetite and generosity in one mark. Tomato red with a zest-lime rind and aubergine ink. The skill flags its honest risk too: some people read the wedge as watermelon.

![Zestly in use](docs/images/zestly-board.png)

### Maison Orvelle — luxury fashion atelier
*Paris womenswear, made-to-measure and small leather goods: elegant, refined, timeless — no crowns, laurels or gold gradients.*

![Maison Orvelle concepts](docs/images/maison-orvelle-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Pendant** — a Didone M whose vertex holds an O like a pendant at a V-neckline; it still reads at 16 px and is solid enough to emboss on leather. The craft pass dropped a shared-foot "LL" (it read as *ORVEILE*) and avoided an M-in-a-circle (too close to a famous transit sign).

![Maison Orvelle in use](docs/images/maison-orvelle-board.png)

### Pulsewave — music & arts festival
*Three-day electronic music and digital-arts festival by a lake: electric, rhythmic, euphoric — no equaliser bars, headphones or vinyl.*

![Pulsewave concepts](docs/images/pulsewave-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Crossing Beams** — two stage lights send four tapered beams; where the inner beams cross they draw the W, like raised arms, and they can sweep to the beat. Electric magenta, ultraviolet and cyan on night. Cyan only reaches 1.5 : 1 on white, so the skill keeps it for dark backgrounds.

![Pulsewave in use](docs/images/pulsewave-board.png)

### Tinkertrail — kids' STEM workshops
*Hands-on robotics and circuits workshops that tour schools: playful, curious, trustworthy — no lightbulbs, atoms, gears or rockets.*

![Tinkertrail concepts](docs/images/tinkertrail-concepts.png)

**Chosen: Signpost t** — the t is a trail signpost pointing kids to the next discovery: a teal stem (the trail) and a coral sign (what's next). The skill had recommended the Workshop Snail; at the checkpoint the client picked the letterform because it stays sturdy for schools and reads at 16 px — exactly what the checkpoint is for.

![Tinkertrail in use](docs/images/tinkertrail-board.png)

### Ralli — padel & tennis app
*Book courts, find partners at your level and join leagues: energetic, social, sporty — no tennis balls, crossed rackets, trophies or swooshes.*

![Ralli concepts](docs/images/ralli-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Rally R** — one italic stroke goes up, over, back and away, like a rally; the leg was snapped to an exact 60°. Electric coral on night-court ink, with acid lime reserved for dark backgrounds.

![Ralli in use](docs/images/ralli-board.png)

### Alderpeak — outdoor gear
*Packs, shells and base layers from the Pacific Northwest: rugged, dependable, honest — no generic mountain-and-sun.*

![Alderpeak concepts](docs/images/alderpeak-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Cairn** — three stacked stones build a summit, a peak and a trail marker in one; the tilted gaps zigzag like a switchback. Rejected along the way: a carabiner *a* (read as "cl") and tree-ring contours (read as a target).

![Alderpeak in use](docs/images/alderpeak-board.png)

### Driftwell — surf hostel & café
*Design-led surf hostel and café on the Portuguese coast: sunny, laid-back, social — no palm trees, sunsets or surfboard silhouettes.*

![Driftwell concepts](docs/images/driftwell-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Azulejo Tile** — a Portuguese azulejo name tile with a D at its heart; laid edge to edge, the corner quarters join into suns. Atlantic blue, tangerine and sun yellow. The audit snapped the W and R diagonals to exact 75° and 45°.

![Driftwell in use](docs/images/driftwell-board.png)

### Calmera — physiotherapy clinic
*Rehab, sports physio and pilates: calm, caring, professional — no crosses, heartbeats, spines or hands-with-hearts.*

![Calmera concepts](docs/images/calmera-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Still Heron** — a heron balancing on one leg in still water; single-leg balance is a standard rehab and pilates exercise, and nothing else in the category looks like it. An early abstract idea was dropped after the peer test found it too close to an existing mark, and the sage was darkened to reach 3 : 1 contrast.

![Calmera in use](docs/images/calmera-board.png)

### Bramble Vet — veterinary clinic
*A family vet for cats and dogs: warm, trustworthy, cheerful — no paws, bones, crosses or stethoscopes.*

![Bramble Vet concepts](docs/images/bramble-vet-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Odd Ears** — one smiling face with a pointed cat ear and a floppy dog ear: every cat and dog belongs. Cobalt and berry on sunny yellow. Several ideas were dropped when the reading test turned them into grapes, an anchor or a teapot.

![Bramble Vet in use](docs/images/bramble-vet-board.png)

### Voltra — solar energy
*Rooftop solar, home batteries and an energy app: bright, optimistic, dependable — no sun rays, leaves, bolts or plugs.*

![Voltra concepts](docs/images/voltra-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Sun Dock** — the sun docks into a battery shaped to hold it, and the gap between them is a crescent moon: *sunshine, after dark*. Volt orange with night navy. A "charge-level o" was dropped because it read as *veltra*.

![Voltra in use](docs/images/voltra-board.png)

### Keyfort — password manager
*Password manager and team-security SaaS with shared vaults, passkeys and access control: secure, calm, strong — no padlocks, shields, keyholes, fingerprints or chain links.*

![Keyfort concepts](docs/images/keyfort-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Greek Key** — one unbroken wall winds inward: a Greek key that is also a fortress with only one way in. Electric indigo sets it apart from the category's azure blues; the innermost turn glows mint only on indigo and dark surfaces, because mint reaches just 1.4 : 1 on white. A star-fort idea was dropped when it read as a shuriken.

![Keyfort in use](docs/images/keyfort-board.png)

### Relaydesk — customer-support SaaS
*One shared inbox for email, chat and social, with AI that drafts replies and routes tickets: helpful, fast, human — no headsets, robots or speech bubbles.*

![Relaydesk concepts](docs/images/relaydesk-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Hand-off** — two identical hooks catch each other mid-pass, so no ticket is dropped: one radius and one stroke, repeated with a 180° turn. Coral only reaches 2.1 : 1 on violet, so on violet surfaces the mark turns all white. The craft pass snapped the *y* to an exact 60° and opened a hook gap that had shrunk to 1.7 units.

![Relaydesk in use](docs/images/relaydesk-board.png)

### Tracelane — product analytics
*Event tracking, funnels and session paths for developers, with an SDK and a CLI: precise, fast, insightful — no bar charts, pie charts, magnifying glasses or up-arrows.*

![Tracelane concepts](docs/images/tracelane-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Junction T** — one lane runs straight on and the other turns off to become the stem: the moment a funnel measures, drawn as the brand initial. Acid green on carbon for the terminal and README, with the turning lane always signal pink. Moving the turning lane inward made the T read at first glance.

![Tracelane in use](docs/images/tracelane-board.png)

### Tallybook — invoicing & bookkeeping
*Invoicing and bookkeeping for small businesses and sole traders: friendly, tidy, reassuring — no calculators, coins, ledgers or charts.*

![Tallybook concepts](docs/images/tallybook-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Bookmark T** — an open book forms the crossbar and its ribbon bookmark forms the stem: your books, always open at the right page. Tangerine with a lagoon-teal ribbon; on tangerine surfaces the ribbon turns ink, because teal and tangerine are nearly equal in luminance and would vibrate.

![Tallybook in use](docs/images/tallybook-board.png)

### Northvault — digital bank for freelancers
*A business account with self-saving tax pots and instant invoicing: confident, clear, independent — no bank blue, coins, piggy banks, columns or up-arrows.*

![Northvault concepts](docs/images/northvault-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Seam N** — a vault-shaped tile split into two interlocking pots, where the seam between them spells N (and N marks north on every compass). Hot magenta, with electric green kept for dark surfaces only. An electric-green card was tested and dropped because the text on it failed contrast.

![Northvault in use](docs/images/northvault-board.png)

### Mediora — telehealth app
*Video consultations with a doctor in minutes, e-prescriptions and records in one place: caring, immediate, warm — no crosses, stethoscopes, hearts or pulse lines.*

![Mediora concepts](docs/images/mediora-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Relief** — a circle face with closed, smiling eyes and a listening head-tilt: the relief of being looked after, fast. A coral face on a teal stage, with ink eyes and wordmark. An early *m* concept put its dot top-right, where it read as "mi", so the dot moved down.

![Mediora in use](docs/images/mediora-board.png)

### Brightdose — online pharmacy
*Repeat prescriptions delivered to your door, with reminders and pharmacist chat: cheerful, reliable, easy — no green crosses, pills, mortar and pestle or rod of Asclepius.*

![Brightdose concepts](docs/images/brightdose-concepts.png)

**Recommended: Sunspot b** — a lowercase *b* that holds a small sun in its counter: a bright spot in every day. Sunrise yellow is rare in a green-and-blue category; on yellow bags and app tiles the whole mark turns one-colour cobalt. Rejected along the way: a seven-bar sun that looked like a helmet and a peel that looked like a moon.

![Brightdose in use](docs/images/brightdose-board.png)

## What the tests catch

Every concept goes through `svg_audit.py` and `preview_sheet.py` before the checkpoint. The test sheet puts the
options side by side at 96 and 32 px, in one colour and reversed, then walks each one down a size ladder to 16 px —
here it shows why Maison Orvelle's wordmark (B) needs a companion mark while the monogram (A) holds up:

![Test sheet](docs/images/test-sheet.png)

The audit turns craft rules into checks. The same run, two files — the recommended lockup and the emblem that was not
recommended:

```text
$ python3 scripts/svg_audit.py a-lockup.svg b-emblem.svg

=== a-lockup.svg
viewBox 0 0 905 256 · aspect 3.535 (horizontal) · colours 1 · anchors 205
· INFO [complexity] 205 anchor points (library median 75, p75 155). Check every point earns its place.
production-readiness score: 99/100

=== b-emblem.svg
viewBox 0 0 256 256 · aspect 1.0 (square) · colours 1 · anchors 374
▲ WARN [complex] 374 anchor points — more than 95% of comparable reference logos (median 53).
▲ WARN [near-miss-angle] 8 straight edge(s) are 0.3–3° off a clean angle … (expected for type set on a curve)
▲ WARN [tiny-detail] 6 sub-shape(s) smaller than 1/48 of the canvas: 4.3×3.1 at (40,77) …
production-readiness score: 76/100
```

## Install

### Claude Code — plugin marketplace (recommended)
```
/plugin marketplace add kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill
/plugin install logo-design@logo-design-skill
```

### Claude Code — manual
Copy the skill folder into your personal (all projects) or project skills directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill.git
cp -r logo-design-skill/skills/logo-design ~/.claude/skills/logo-design          # personal
# or: cp -r logo-design-skill/skills/logo-design .claude/skills/logo-design     # per project
```

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop
Download `logo-design.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill/releases) page (or run
`python3 tools/package_skill.py`) and upload it under **Settings → Capabilities → Skills**. If your upload has a size
limit, use `logo-design-lite.zip` (everything except the SVG files themselves).

### Gemini CLI, Codex CLI and other agents
The skill uses the open **Agent Skills** format (a folder with a `SKILL.md`), so it works in any agent that supports
skills — the instructions are plain Markdown and the tools are plain Python. Clone once, then copy the folder into
your agent's skills directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaankiziltug/logo-design-skill.git
```

| Agent | Personal (all projects) | Per project |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/logo-design` (or `~/.agents/skills/`) | `.gemini/skills/logo-design` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/skills/logo-design` | `.codex/skills/logo-design` |
| Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, others | see your agent's skills docs | usually a `skills/` folder in the project |

```bash
cp -r logo-design-skill/skills/logo-design ~/.gemini/skills/logo-design     # Gemini CLI
cp -r logo-design-skill/skills/logo-design ~/.codex/skills/logo-design      # Codex CLI
```
Start a new session and ask for a logo; the agent picks the skill up from its description. The skill works best with
a model that can view images, because it renders its own drafts to PNG and checks them before showing you anything.
The `.claude-plugin/` folder is only used by Claude Code and is ignored elsewhere.

## Use

Just ask — the skill triggers on logo, wordmark, monogram, brand mark, app icon, favicon, rebrand and critique requests:

> *"Design a logo for **Harbor**, a savings app for first-time savers. It should feel calm and safe."*
> *"Here's our current logo (logo.svg) — critique it and suggest a refresh."*
> *"Give me three wordmark directions for a specialty coffee roaster called Kiln."*
> *"Turn this symbol into favicon, app icon and one-colour versions, plus a one-page usage guide."*

Tools can also be run directly:
```bash
cd skills/logo-design
python3 scripts/search_library.py --technique negative-space --exemplary
python3 scripts/search_library.py --industry payments-fintech --summary
python3 scripts/svg_audit.py my-logo.svg
python3 scripts/concept_sheet.py a.svg b.svg c.svg --names "A" "B" "C" --recommend 1 -o concepts.png
python3 scripts/preview_sheet.py my-logo.svg --refs-industry developer-tools -o preview.html
python3 scripts/render_png.py my-logo.svg --size 512 -o my-logo.png
python3 scripts/export_variants.py my-logo.svg --mono "#0F7C80" --icon-bg "#0F7C80" --web-icons
open assets/library/gallery.html      # browse the library visually
```
Requires Python 3.8+ (standard library only). PNG/ICO export uses whatever renderer is available: `cairosvg`,
`rsvg-convert`, Inkscape, a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) or macOS Quick Look.
